# üñ•Ô∏è Task 7 ‚Äì Monitor System Resources using Netdata

## üìå Objective
The goal of this task was to install and run **Netdata**, a lightweight and open-source monitoring tool, in order to monitor real-time system performance metrics such as CPU, memory, disk usage, and Docker containers. The task also involved exploring Netdata‚Äôs **dashboard, alerts, and logs**.

---

## ‚ö° Steps Performed

### 1. Deployment of Netdata
Netdata was deployed using Docker. Once the container was running, the monitoring service was available at:

http://localhost:19999
This URL opened the **Netdata Dashboard**, which provides a rich set of performance metrics updated in real time.

### 2. Exploring the Dashboard
After launching the dashboard in the browser, we observed:
- **CPU Usage** ‚Äì real-time utilization across all CPU cores.  
- **Memory Usage** ‚Äì details of RAM and swap usage.  
- **Disk I/O** ‚Äì read/write activity and performance trends.  
#Alerts are shown directly on the dashboard and highlight potential issues such as high CPU usage, memory pressure, or disk bottlenecks.
### Exploring Logs
